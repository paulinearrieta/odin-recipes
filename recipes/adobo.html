            <li>4 bay leaves (fresh) or 3 dried</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>FOR COOKING</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp oil <em>, separated (vegetable, canola or peanut)</em></li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves <em>, minced</em></li>
            <li>1 small brown onion <em>, diced</em></li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups (375 ml) water</li>
            <li>1 tbsp whole black pepper <em>(sub 2 tsp coarse cracked pepper)</em></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>SERVING</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 green onions/scallions <em>, sliced (garnish)</em></li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine Chicken and Marinade ingredients in a bowl. Marinate for at least 20 minutes, or up to overnight.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a skillet over high heat. Remove chicken from marinade (reserve marinade) and place in the pan. Sear both sides until browned – about 1 minute on each side. Do not cook the chicken all the way through</li>
            <li>Remove chicken skillet and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat the remaining oil in skillet. Add garlic and onion, cook 1 1/2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the reserved marinade, water, sugar and black pepper. Bring it to a simmer then turn heat down to medium high. Simmer 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add chicken smooth side down. Simmer uncovered for 20 to 25 minutes (no need to stir), turning chicken at around 15 minutes, until the sauce reduces down to a thick jam-like syrup.</li>
            <li>If the sauce isn't thick enough, remove chicken onto a plate and let the sauce simmer by itself - it will thicken much quicker - then return chicken to the skillet to coat in the glaze.</li>
            <li>Coat chicken in glaze then serve over rice.</li>
        </ol>
